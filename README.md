# How to Build a Strong Online Presence

It doesn't matter if you are a graphic designer, copywriter, web developer or translator. If you can turn your talent or skills into profit, you have what it takes to be a high earning individual. By placing your ideas on local forums, groups in social media or portals, you will gain recognition. You will also gain the trust of future customers and employers who will find out about your skills. That's what this post is all about.

## Social Media
More than ever before we are all hooked to social media. If you do not have a social media strategy yet, make one! Convey a clear, strong and visually enticing message. Simply being active doesn't do it.

## LinkedIn
Ideally, your summary should go back to as far as your education, describe your work experience and skills concisely and comprehensively. There is ample space to share certificates, projects, publications and other feats. Prior work experience during your studies will almost always get you a job. If you are aiming at high profile MNC's such as Google you will have to do well academically unless you can compensate it with significant project work.

Networking doesn't have to be done in person. Browse through member profiles and connect to those you can relate to on a professional level. Have your CV ready in case you are actively seeking employment.

## Website
It is obvious. You want to earn money by selling beautiful leather bags. But first the industry needs to recognize your talent. Without a portfolio, no one will know what bags you make! Then nobody will trust you and you won't earn any money! And that's why you should put your work on the web! Besides platforms like Soundcloud where you can upload your recorded songs, you should think about a professional portfolio.

Take advantage of website builders. Amongst the great number of templates you will also find those dedicated to your industry. The most important thing is the appearance, thanks to which you will convey emotions, achieve a professional image and show your love for your craft. Keep your site up-to-date.

## Blog
Blogs are multi-purpose and used by many - for knowledge sharing, ecommerce, digital marketing, magazines, etc. It's worth all the extra work if you are a regular and your posts are unique (e.g. travel stories). In all other cases I find it redundant and a waste of domain space. Ask yourself: *What does the blog convey about me?*. Keep your personal life private. On company pages blogs are used for news and recent updates, perhaps even branding. Vlogs (video blogs) on YouTube are also quite widely used.

## GitHub
Everyone should have a GitHub account! Not only can you share your own, but also contribute to others' work. This goes under the term open-source: software everyone can use and modify freely. Since active work makes up 80% of our learning (the remaining is 20% pure theory) GitHub perfectly fits into the learning process. If you don't have anything to show learn HTML/CSS, build a couple of websites and share them with the outer world (some [examples](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-web-developer-course-build-10-websites-from-scratch/))! Your portfolio will almost immediately get you a job, if not a very good one.

## Medium
Medium is *the* source of news on technology but their catalogue of topics stretches far beyond that and encompasses art, food, culture, humor, sports and music. You can use Medium to keep yourself up to date and build your knowledge. Sharing and subscribing is very simple. and fun.

## Groups
Groups give a sense of belonging. Sadly, most people do not actively contribute nor participate in discussions. Moreover, some just use it to brand themselves. That's plain wrong! Use this opportunity to connect to like-minded members, forge new relationships and grow your network, one step at a time.
