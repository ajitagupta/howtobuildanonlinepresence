# How to Build a Strong Online Presence

> It sounds a little extreme, but in this day and age, if your work isn’t online, it doesn’t exist. We all have the opportunity  to use our voices, to have our

If you just focus on getting really good people will come to you. You don't really find an audience for your work; they find you. But it’s not enough to be good. In order to be found, you have to be findable. There’s an easy way of putting your work out there and making it discoverable while you're focused on getting really good at what you do. That's what this post is all about.

## Social Media and Forums
More than ever before we are all hooked to social media. If you do not have a social media strategy yet, make one! Convey a clear, strong and visually enticing message. Simply being active doesn't do it. Go above and beyond. Think outside the box - creativity is a key ingredient to success!

It doesn't matter if you are a graphic designer, copywriter, web developer or translator. If you can turn your talent or skills into profit, you have what it takes to be a high earning individual. By placing your ideas on local forums, social media or portals, you will gain recognition. You will also gain the trust of future customers and employers who will find out about your skills.

## LinkedIn
Ideally, your summary should go back to as far as your education, describe your work experience and skills concisely and comprehensively. There is ample space to share certificates, projects, publications and other feats. Prior work experience during your studies will almost always get you a job. If you are aiming at high profile MNC's such as Google you will have to do well academically unless you can compensate it with significant project work.

Networking doesn't have to be done in person. Browse through member profiles and connect to those you can relate to on a professional level. Have your CV ready in case you are actively seeking employment.

## Website
It is obvious. You want to earn money by selling beautiful leather bags. But first the industry needs to recognize your talent. Without a portfolio, no one will know what bags you make! Then nobody will trust you and you won't earn any money! And that's why you should put your work on the web! Besides platforms like Soundcloud where you can upload your recorded songs, you should think about a professional portfolio.

Take advantage of website builders. Amongst the great number of templates you will also find those dedicated to your industry. The most important thing is the appearance, thanks to which you will convey emotions, achieve a professional image and show your love for your craft. Keep your site up-to-date.

## Blog
Blogs are multi-purpose and used by many - for knowledge sharing, ecommerce, digital marketing, magazines, etc. It's worth all the extra work if you are a regular and your posts are unique (e.g. travel stories). In all other cases I find it redundant and a waste of domain space. Ask yourself: *What does the blog convey about me?*. Keep your personal life private. On company pages blogs are used for news and recent updates, perhaps even branding. Vlogs (video blogs) on YouTube are also quite widely used.

## GitHub
Today, an artist can share whatever she wants, whenever she wants, with whomever she wants and at almost no cost. This goes under the term open-source: software everyone can use and modify freely. GitHub allows to share your code with others. It also gives you the opportunitiy to garner feedback and improve your code. Since active work makes up most of our learning GitHub perfectly fits into the learning process.

Create your GitHub account! You can build mobile apps and curated lists of your favourite learning material! You can design a website. You can write a tutorial. And share it with the world!

## Medium
Medium is *the* source of news on technology but their catalogue of topics stretches far beyond that and encompasses art, food, culture, humor, sports and music. You can use Medium to keep yourself up to date on current trends in [data science](https://towardsdatascience.com/), learn about [startups](https://medium.com/swlh), read a tutorial on version control and build your knowledge progressively. Use these articles for inspiration and finally share your own story.

> In order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen - really seen.

## Groups
Groups give a sense of belonging. Sadly, most people do not actively contribute nor participate in discussions. Moreover, some just use it to brand themselves. That's plain wrong! Use this opportunity to connect to like-minded members, forge new relationships and grow your network, one step at a time. Moreover, by generously sharing ideas and knowledge, you often gain an audience you can then leverage when you need it - for fellowship, feedback or patronage.

Imagine losing your job but having a social network of people familiar with your work and ready to help you find a new one. Imagine turning a side project or a hobby into your profession because you had a following that could support you. Or imagine something simpler and just as satisfying: spending the majority of your time, energy, and attention
practicing a craft, learning a trade, or running a business, while also allowing for the possibility that your work might attract a group of people who share your interests.

All you have to do is show your work.
